This repository is a FreePBX dynamic xml phonebook generator for GXP21xx/GXP14xx/GXP116x grandstream phones that also includes the ability to dynamically pull in queues from FreePBX.

Place this script in /var/www/html and point your Grandstream phones to it to get a phonebook with all the contacts and queues on your PBX. The phone will authenticate with the same login credentials that is uses for SIP.

This is a modification of grintor's script located at https://github.com/grintor/freepbx-grandstream-phonebook.
